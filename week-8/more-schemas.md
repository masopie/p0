####REFLECTION!
######What is a one-to-one database?
- A situation where two entities (tables) have a single relationship to each other. More plainly put, it is where one thing can only have one of the other thing, and vice versa. So, with the country/capital example, the former can only have one of the latter, and the latter can only exist for one of the former!

######When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
- Again, really, any time where you have two different things that can only have one thing connecting them.

######What is a many-to-many database?
- It's a situation where two or more entities (tables) can have 0, 1, or many relationships with each other. A bit more explicitly, when one or more rows in a table can be related to 0, 1, or more rows in another.

######When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
- Anytime two things could have a lot of things from each other! I mean... well let's see. If a business offers different products, they're going to potentially have "many" customers. And those customers are potentially going to have "many" of their products!

######What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
- The most confusing thing is probably just thinking of examples. I think, when you have a project in front of you, the type of database schema you'll need will become apparently *very* quickly. However, when you are forced to think up examples, stuff becomes clear REAL quickly.
