<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    A little intimidating! I guess the lack of any styling makes it a bit better. It certainly wasn't too frustrating, just many typing corrections to look out for. ;)
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    Good! It seems so intuitive. However, I feel guilty, almost like I am less capable not knowing non-semantic elements well. But oh well, gotta stick with the times, right?!
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    My pair and I did fine, I think. It was only a little tempting but it's so very easy to just go into "OK ROUGH DRAFT TIME" mode and not be bothered by it.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    It's great from a design process perspective because of it's simplicity. I'm tempted to say it's almost... too simple. It's a seemingly basic language with a basic, foundational utility. The bad? IT'S SO CLUNKY! Even with the semantic element changes, it just takes such laborous amounts of time to type.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    The same heuristic techniques as with, say, CLI work: try something out if you think you remember it and it'll stick better, whether you actually do or don't. Also, hey - HTML is great at having tags ("code"?) whose names associate with their functions naturally.
