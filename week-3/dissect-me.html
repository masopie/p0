    <h2>What is Git anyway?!</h2>
    <p>
        Git, a local version control system, helps you track changes by encouraging the use of a "master" and branches. The master is the walking, talking, working, unblemished original that you integrate branches, or versions being worked on, into once they are themselves working and finished. Git lets you keep the master free from accidental bugs by keeping branches separate and using a "commit," or little summary/log of changes, each time you merge a branch with the master.

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
    A lot of what seem like the basics: the skeleton's skeleton (html, head, body, footer) and some of the really helpful common tags (h1-6, p). We didn't link anything but we did get an itch to use some of the semantic HTML5 tags, despite much practice with div's.
  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
    Elements get laid out in boxes, called simply "the box model" you can see this with Chrome DevTools. We decided that the browser likely just goes for the neck with the content first and then works out how to display it (sort of like going from the center and working outward). In other words: take the content and figure out how we've styled it!
  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
    I absolutely think I will create more snippets! Sublime is already massively helpful, just like iTerm. It saves (fractions of) seconds on every line, and, y'know. Little things add up. I am, though, glad the exercise wasn't more opaque than it was. It could very easily have crossed from "useful quick research exercise" to "frustrating overcomplication of a really simple and negligable thing you really didn't need to memorize in the first place." I'd really like to know what other developers find useful before hunting for other snippets!-->
