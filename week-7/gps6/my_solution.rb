# MY SOLUTION

# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Reuben Brendt].
# We spent [1.5] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#
#
# require_relative 'state_data'

class VirusPredictor

  #Initializing an instance of VirusPredictor with 3 arguments. Each argument becomes an instance variable
  def initialize(state_of_origin, population_density, population)
    @state = state_of_origin
    @population = population
    @population_density = population_density
  end

  #Setting up (w/o specific output, other than variables passed) 2 methods
  def virus_effects
    predicted_deaths
    speed_of_spread
  end

  #Makes all methods below "private" only callable inside the class
  private

  #Determines predicted death based on the relationship between population density & population. Proportionate to size.
  def predicted_deaths
    # predicted deaths is solely based on population density
    if @population_density >= 200
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.4).floor
    elsif @population_density >= 150
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.3).floor
    elsif @population_density >= 100
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.2).floor
    elsif @population_density >= 50
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.1).floor
    else
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.05).floor
    end

    print "#{@state} will lose #{number_of_deaths} people in this outbreak"

  end

  #Based entirely on population density. Establishes speed based on how desne population densities are.
  def speed_of_spread #in months
    # We are still perfecting our formula here. The speed is also affected
    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.
    speed = 0.0

    if @population_density >= 200
     speed += 0.5
    elsif @population_density >= 150
      speed += 1

      speed += 1.5

    end

    puts " and will spread across the state in #{speed} months.\n\n"

# Reflection Section

# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
# => The larger "hashy hash" with the rockets (=>) uses 'strings' as its keys. The inner hashes use :symbols. If you're going to be using a billion methods in that same class, it's better to use the latter, symbols.
# => ...You see, each instance of a string - even if it looks the same as the last - is a new object. And anything new or changed = more memory consumed. Things can hog memory fast. Symbols, however, can represent individual, frequently recurring words or variables, if your content is huge but the vocab is limited!
# => ^ http://www.randomhacks.net/2007/01/20/13-ways-of-looking-at-a-ruby-symbol/#12

# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
# => Require_relative just hunts down a similarly-/that-named file in the same folder. Require mandates the reference file be at a specific location and that you list that specific path.

# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
# => Each! You just have to remember: you're going to have TWO placeholders. And if one of those placeholders contains a nested hash? Well, that's going to have to have nested iteration with two uses of hashname[]!

# When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
# => "Passing" the variables to predicted_deaths & speed_of_spread wasn't actually passing them anything at all. Those are the mighty INSTANCE VARIABLES that they're using in the private methods below! We don't have to use them at all in virus_effects!!!!

# What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
# => Instance variables: where they can be used, how powerful & salient they are, etc. Oh, and PRIVATE!
